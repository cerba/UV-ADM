# Welcome! 

This repository contains the `UV-ADM` code published in Erba et al. (2021), MNRAS 506.4, 5373. 
Results from this code and project have been highlighted in other publications, posters, talks, workshops, etc.

For more information, contact: christi.erba@gmail.com.

# To run the code:
  `adm_basecode_master.py` contains the functions governing the velocity, density, magnetic, etc. parameters of the model. 
  Do NOT change this file (unless you know what you're doing, and then do so with extreme caution!).
  
  `indat_master.py` contains all the input parameters needed to run a model (generating a single synthetic line profile).

  `adm_full_v6.py` is the file used to generate the synthetic line profile (model). 
  This version (6) also contains code to generate synthetic Stokes V profiles.

  The `shock_retreat_parameters` directory contains the reference files the code needs to run a full model.
  Currently, the code supports models using $\chi_{\infty} = 0.01, 0.1, 0.0, 1.0, 10.0$ only. Contact the author for additional applications.
